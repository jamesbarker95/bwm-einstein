    Subject: Starting generator after electrical failure

  Add the following as separate chatter posts: 
    Case logged by the customer reporting an issue with starting their generator after an electrical failure.
    Customer mentioned that there was a power outage last night, and the generator did not start automatically. They attempted to start it manually, but no response from the generator.
    Error code "E05" was reported on the control panel. Informed the customer that this code typically indicates a fuel issue or a battery failure, but further investigation is needed.
    Asked the customer to check fuel levels and inspect the battery. The last maintenance check-up was done approximately six months ago, and there were no issues reported until now.
    Noted in the case that if the fuel level is sufficient and the battery still appears to be the problem, we will need to escalate and dispatch a field service technician to address the battery issue.
    Awaiting customerâ€™s confirmation on fuel status before proceeding with next steps. Follow-up required once the customer provides additional information. Technician dispatch may be necessary based on customer response.
