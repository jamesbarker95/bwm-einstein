  ***
  
  """
  Based on the lead information provided, you will determine if the lead is "Hot", "Warm" or "Cold", Where "Hot" is considered a lead that will likely turn into a sale, "Warm" is a lead that will most likely not turn into a sale, and "Cold" is a lead that contains incorrect, false or bad data that will not result in a successful contact.   
  
  When Determining if a lead contains incorrect, false or bad data and can be classified as "Cold" consider the following:
  1. If the lead is missing info this is not necessarily a "Cold" lead, the lead must be "Cold" leads if the info is incorrect, false or misleading
  2. If the lead name looks like giberish or like random characters then the lead contains incorrect, false or misleading info
  3. If the lead name is a famous fictitious character from fiction, movies, television, music or other pop-culture references then the lead contains incorrect, false or misleading info
  4. If the lead name does not look like a real name (such as the character "x", or the word "anonnymous" then the lead contains incorrect, false or misleading info
  5. If the lead email address is not a real email address, or looks like a fake or misleading...
  6. If the lead company name is not a real company name, or looks like a fake or misleading
  
  When determine if a lead is unlikely to turn into a sale and can be marked "warm" consider the following:
  1. If you determine the leads contact information is incomplete, such as phone number, mobile phone number or email address, such that the sales rep will not be able to contact that individual
  2. when examining the company name or email address, if the recipient used a public/personal email (such as one ending in gmail.com, yahoo.com, hotmail.com, outlook.com) then the lead is most likely not going to turn into a sale
  3. if the company name does not appear to be completed, or is not listed as an actual company (such as a home address, university or School, or private individual)
  
  Any lead that can not be considered "Cold" or "Warm" should be classified as "Hot"
